  npcDialogues:
  - "Ah, a traveler! You don\u2019t seem like you\u2019re from around here. What
    brings you to our village?"
  - Yes, the Rusty Lantern is just down the road. But tell me, have you heard about
    the strange disappearances lately?
  - "Villagers have gone missing near the old ruins in the forest. If you\u2019re
    heading that way, be careful."
  playerResponses:
  - "I'm just passing through. Do you know if there\u2019s an inn nearby where I
    can rest?"
  - "Disappearing people? No, I haven't. What\u2019s going on?"
  - Thanks for the warning. Do you know anyone who might have more information?
